# Grincoin.org (GRIN) Blockchain Explorer

## What is Grin?
Grin is the very first, simple and fair MimbleWimble blockchain implementation.

- Scalable, privacy-preserving blockchain.
- Fair and verifiable coin distribution.
- Not controlled by any company, foundation or individual.

## Prerequisites

- Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
